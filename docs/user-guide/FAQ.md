## How can I better integrate my router to the network?

Edit your settings: set correct bandwidth and share rate. 

Run i2pd for a long time, download and seed some popular torrents.

## What browser should I use to browse I2P websites?

Use any opensource browser - for example, Firefox or Chromium based. Create separate profile for I2P ([firefox instructions](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles)), try not to mix clearnet browsing with I2P. Learn how to configure your browser for better privacy and security.

Good idea is to configure [privoxy](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Privoxy) for I2P/onion/clearnet browsing at the same time.

i2pd socks proxy has an option to pass all non-i2p traffic to Tor socks proxy. Make sure you know what are you doing!
